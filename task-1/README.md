# Todo List Application

This Todo List Application is a simple yet powerful tool to manage your daily tasks. Built with Spring Boot, Hibernate, and PostgreSQL, it provides a RESTful API to create, read, update, and delete todo items, each with a title and description.

## Features

- Create todo items with title and description
- Retrieve a list of all todo items
- Retrieve a specific todo item by ID
- Update the title and description of an existing todo item
- Delete a todo item

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java JDK 11 or later
- Maven or Gradle (whichever is used as a build tool)
- PostgreSQL installed and running on your local machine

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-list-api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd todo-list-api
   ```

3. Open the `application.properties` file and update the PostgreSQL database connection details:

   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/yourdb
   spring.datasource.username=yourusername
   spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
   ```

4. Build the application using Maven or Gradle:

   For Maven:

   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

   For Gradle:

   ```sh
   gradle build
   ```

## Running the Application

Run the application using the Spring Boot Maven plugin:

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run

```

The application will start and be available at `http://localhost:8080`.
